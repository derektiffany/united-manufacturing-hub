  This docker container automatically detects cameras in the network and makes them accessible via MQTT. 
  The MQTT output is specified in [the MQTT documentation](/docs/content/en/docs/Concepts/mqtt)


**This microservice is still in development and is not considered stable for production use.**

## Getting started

### Using the Helm chart

By default, cameraconnect will be deactivated in factorycube-edge. First, 
you need to enable it in the factorycube-edge values. 
Then you need to create a folder on the node in `/home/rancher/genticam_producer`
and move your genTL producer files (*.cti) and all required libraries into that folder. 
Then apply your settings to the Helm chart with `helm upgrade`.

With Lens, you can change the values under the apps/releases tab on the left side. 
Select factorycube-edge and change your config values.


Or overwrite it in the `~/configs/development_values.yaml` file on the cube itself. 

To apply the changes to the development_values.yaml you will need to execute this command 
````shell
helm upgrade factorycube-edge united-manufacturing-hub/factorycube-edge \
--values "/home/rancher/configs/factorycube-edge-development.yaml" \
--set serialNumber=$(hostname) --kubeconfig /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml -n factorycube-edge
````
Furthermore, you need to adjust the MQTT_HOST to the externally exposed MQTT IP (e.g., the IP of your node). 
Usually you can use the Kubernetes internal DNS,
but cameraconnect needs to be in hostMode = true and therefore you need to access it through the external ip. 

### cti files
cti files for your cameras can not be included for license reasons, to include ti files you must create the folder 
`/home/rancher/genicam_producer` and place a zip file containing all the files you wish to use there. the script will
look for all cti files in that directory. Getting CTI files is dependent on the manufacturer, 
usually you will need to extract them from the installation of the camera manufacturers software, 
due to licensing issues we can not distribute them with the stack.

### general tips.
1. Get cti files for both your development system and the container system (Debian / Ubuntu)
   
   set the log level to DEBUG during any kind of hardware or network changes.
   

2. Try  Files from other manufacturers as well, they all behave differently, some support more cameras than others, 
   and in different ways. "Stemmer Imaging" and "Baumer" files appear to work relatively well with other manufacturers
   

3. Testing which cti files work with your cameras can be a very tedious process

   
4. What works in your test environment may or may not work in deployment, I recommend modifying your deployment in lens  
   to use and creating a custom docker image during testing if you get stuck, 
   (you can use the docker hub container repository for free) 


5. use an IDE to get more control over your environment where you run your tests (both env variables and python venvs),
   this application was made to be used with docker, and therefore expects tight control over the environment. 


6. Docker containers behave slightly different when hosted on Windows or k3os, 
   especially when mounting files like configs or cti files from the host OS, 
   this can result in very hard to debug errors.


### Development setup
#### docker compose
Here is a quick tutorial on how to start up a basic configuration / a basic docker-compose stack, 
so that you can develop.

1. Specify the environment variables, e.g. in a .env file in the main folder or directly in the docker-compose
2. execute `sudo docker-compose -f ./deployment/cameraconnect/docker-compose.yaml up -d --build`
#### IDE
1. Set up your python venv, with the same version of python the container is built with, check 
   [the Dockerfile for details](/deployment/cameraconnect/Dockerfile)
2. Install [requirements](/cameraconnect/requirements.txt)
3. Setup env variables for your execution of the [main program](/cameraconnect/src/main.py) 
   (run config for pycharm or launch settings for vs code)
4. Run the entire stack with cameraconnect DISABLED in development mode on a system in the same network
5. Test your hardware from your machine, connecting to the stack as MQTT broker
6. After it works on your dev device, transfer it to the umh stack by enabling cameraconnect on the stack
7. If you need to do changes to cameraconnect, you can create your own docker image and publish it on dockerhub
   then you can change the kubernetes deployment to use your image instead of the official one, please make sure that
   you do not publish any kind of confidential data on public repositories. 
   ````shell
   docker build --tag=<your_name>/cameraconnect:latest -f deployment/cameraconnect/Dockerfile . && 
   docker push <your_name>/cameraconnect:latest
   ````
## Environment variables

This chapter explains all used environment variables.

### CUBE_TRANSMITTERID

Description: The unique transmitter id. This will be used for the creation of the MQTT topic. ia/raw/TRANSMITTERID/...

Type: string

Possible values: all

Example value: 2021-0156

### MQTT_HOST

**Description:** The MQTT broker URL

**Type:** string

**Possible values:** IP, DNS name

**Example value:** ia_mosquitto

**Example value 2:** localhost

### MQTT_PORT

**Description:** The MQTT broker port. Only unencrypted ports are allowed here (default: 1883)

**Type:** integer

**Possible values:** all

**Example value:** 1883

### TRIGGER

**Description:** Defines the option of how the camera is triggered. <br>
Either via MQTT or via a continuous time trigger. <br>
In production the camera should be triggered via MQTT. The continuous time trigger is just convenient for debugging.<br>
If MQTT is selected, the camera will be triggered by any message which arrives via its subscribed MQTT topic.<br>
However, if the arriving MQTT message contains a UNIX timestamp in milliseconds with the key "timestamp_ms", <br>
the camera will be triggered at that exact timestamp.

**Type:** string

**Possible values:** MQTT, Continuous

**Example value:** MQTT

### ACQUISITION_DELAY

**Description:** Time in seconds which delays the image acquisition after the camera has been triggered.<br>
This is mostly used, if the camera is triggered with a UNIX timestamp (see variable TRIGGER), to make sure, that the <br>
camera is triggered, even if the UNIX timestamps lies in the past. This could be caused by network latencies.


**Type:** float

**Possible values:** all

**Example value:** 0.7

### CYCLE_TIME

**Description:** Only relevant if the trigger is set to "Continuous". Cycle time gives the time period which defines<br> 
the frequency in which the camera is triggered.
<br>For example: a value of 0.5 would result in a trigger frequency of 2 images per second.

**Type:** float

**Possible values:** all

**Example value:** 1.5

### CAMERA_INTERFACE

**Description:** Defines which camera interface is used, currently only cameras of the GenICam standard are supported.
However, for development of testing you can also use the DummyCam, 
which simulates a camera and sends a static image via MQTT, <br>when triggered.

**Type:** String

**Possible values:** GenICam, DummyCam

**Example value:** GenICam

### EXPOSURE_TIME

**Description:** Defines the exposure time for the selected camera. You should adjust this to your 
local environment to achieve optimal images.

**Type:** int

**Possible values:** Depends on camera interface. Values between 1 and 80,000 are eligible for most cameras.

**Example value:** 1000

### EXPOSURE_AUTO

**Description:**  Determines if camera automatically adjusts the exposure time.
Your settings will only be executed if
the camera supports this. You do not have to check if the camera supports this.

**Type:** String

**Possible values:** <br>"Off" -  No automatic adjustment <br>
"Once" - Adjusted once<br>
"Continuous" - Continuous adjustment (not recommended, Attention: 
This could have a big impact on the frame rate of your camera)

**Example value:** Off

### PIXEL_FORMAT

**Description:**  Sets the pixel format which will be used for image acquisition. This module allows you to acquire <br>
images in monochrome pixel formats(use: "Mono8") and RGB/BRG color pixel formats (use:"RGB8Packed" or "BGR8Packed")

**Type:** String

**Possible values:** Mono8, RGB8Packed, BGR8Packed

**Example value:** Mono8

### IMAGE_WIDTH

**Description:**  Defines the horizontal width of the images acquired, if the width values surpasses the maximum 
capability of the camera the maximum value is set automatically.

**Type:** int

**Possible values:** all except 0

**Example value:** 1000

### IMAGE_HEIGHT

**Description:**  Defines the vertical height of the images acquired, if the height value surpasses the maximum 
capability of the camera the maximum value is set automatically.

**Type:** int

**Possible values:** all except 0

**Example value:** 1000

### IMAGE_CHANNELS

**Description:**  Number of channels (bytes per pixel) that are used in the array (third dimension of the image data <br>
array).You do not have to set this value. If None, the best number of channels for your set pixel format will be used.

**Type:** int

**Possible values:** 1 or 3

**Example value:** 1

### MAC_ADDRESS

**Description:**  Defines which camera is accessed by the container. One container can use only one camera. <br>
The MAC address can be found on the backside of the camera.<br>
The input is not case-sensitive. Please follow the example format below.

**Type:** String

**Possible values:** all

**Example value:** 0030532B879C

### LOGGING_LEVEL

**Description:**  Defines which logging level is used. 
Mostly relevant for developers. Use WARNING or ERROR in production.

**Type:** String

**Possible values:** DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL

**Example value:** DEBUG
